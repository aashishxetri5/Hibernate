## Fetching Specific Columns:

String hql = "SELECT b.title, a.name FROM Book b JOIN b.author a";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
List<Object[]> result = query.list();

- You retrieve only specific columns or properties from the entities. The result is a list of arrays or other simple data structures.


## Aliasing Entities:

String hql = "SELECT b.title, a.name FROM Book b JOIN b.author a";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
List<Object[]> result = query.list();

- You retrieve entire entities with all their properties. The result is a list of objects that include the full entity objects.
